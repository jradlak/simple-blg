Thoughts about what things I will posting on my blog.

1. How I made my jrdbase application - generic base for Scaffolding of Web Application
	a) How I customize JHhipter generated code to meet my requirements.
		- enable sending e-mails
		- add polish language translations
		- do small customizations to user interface
	b) How I ddd custom role / authorities management system. Roles should be dynamicly managed when application is running.
		- add database infrastructure for roles
		- add UI forms for CRUD do roles and change permissions.
		- connect visibility of UI elements with corresponding roles - possibility of dynamicly changing this visibility 
		  when changing reles and assigment users to roles.

2. How I transform my jrdbase application into full functional blog application.
	a) Possible simple script which translates all possible constants into new values (ex.: name of application, database name, etc.)
		- written in JavaScript or Bash or Python
	b) Add roles for writers and readers.
		- writers can publish articles
		- readers can rate articles and publish comments
	c) Add tag and search subsystem
	d) Customize UI to meet blog application requirements (add menu, etc, "tags cloud", search bar)
